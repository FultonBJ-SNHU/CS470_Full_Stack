# CS470-Full_Stack_II

Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.

In this course, we explored several services offered by AWS. These services such as S3, API gateway, Lambda are common tools offered by many cloud-computing companies. In learning the functionality, use-case, and integration of these clout-computing services I have expanded my capabilities with software development and opened up many new possibilities for a future career in any company that relies on these services. 

What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

The single skill that I have learned and further developed with this course is problem solving. In the ever developing world of technology, and the reliance on liobraries, dependencies, third party services, it is more often the case than not that things don't always go as planned. Hidden bugs, outdated dependencies, conflicting software and many more issues are all things that have to be delt with and solutions aren't always as easy as a quick google search. My ability to overcome issues, even when the root of the problem isn't apparent has definetly been tested and developed in this course and others. I know that problem solving and being skilled in the "set up" process is a valuable set of skilss to have and maintain in any of the areas of software engineering. 





Describe your strengths as a software developer.
As a software engineer, I have found that I have a good handle on many of the programming concepts such as object oriented programming, coding best practices, and the importance of documentation. 

Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.

Over the course of my studies, I found an interest in Artificial intelligence and embedded programming. I don't feel ready to take on a role as an AI/ML programmer yet but I am interested in studying further and perhaps earn a masters degree in the field. I have been accepted into a program to intern for a defense contractor that has a need for new embedded programmers in 2005 and I'm excited to focus on that aspect of software engineering and begin as a junior embedded developer. 

Planning for Growth: Synthesize the knowledge you have gathered about cloud services.
Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the following:
How would you handle scale and error handling?
How would you predict the cost?
What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?

Handling a web app that needs to scale has become extremely user friendly and the easiest route is to hand the task off to one of many cloud service providers that offer automatic scaling such as AWS or DigitalOcean. For error handling, google provides a great tool with Gtest that integrates well into my favorite IDE, VS Code. Predicting cost at scale can be tricky, there are a lot of unknowns such as different regions becoming more popular or the time at which higher traffic volumes are seen. To best handle the unknown aspects of cost at scale, limits can be implimented so that usage can be limited to expectations. This may cause harm to a growing business but if I were to ever launch a web app or business that relied on cloud services it would be Open Source since I have a strong affinity for the Open Source community and my career plans lie in embedded and edge AI technologies. 
When looking for cost prediction, its very use-case dependent. Both serverless and containers have the potential to scale quickly and with it cost associated would rise as well. In fact there is no black or white serverless vs containers since the two can be used both in sync and built to depend on each other. Planning on growth while limiting cost could be a tricky endeavor. My thoughts on how to accomplish this relate to an app that I came up with for a previous class. In this app, Users interact with the GUI and make database calls to different HTTP sites maintained by the government. Since va.org hosts easy to use APIs with documentation, my plan would be to code the API calls into the app and save the data to the users device. There would be no need for cloud storage, function calls, or other costly cloud-computing services. The database is already maintained by the government and the data pulled to a single users device are only a few lines of text for each call so size on the users device wouldn't be a problem either.
